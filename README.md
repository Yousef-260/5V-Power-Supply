## 5V-Power-Supply
A 5V power supply is a circuit that converts an unregulated power source, typically a higher AC or DC voltage, into a stable, regulated 5V DC output. These power supplies are essential for powering a wide range of electronic devices, especially those with digital logic circuits like microcontrollers and sensors.
